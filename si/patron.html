  <h2>Rewards for Patrons</h2>
  <ol>
      <li>
          <strong>Custom Character Creation:</strong>
          <p>Offer patrons the opportunity to collaborate with you on the creation of a custom game character. They can provide input on the character's appearance, personality, backstory, and abilities.</p>

      <li>
          <strong>In-Game Cameo Appearances:</strong>
          <p>Reward higher-tier patrons with cameo appearances of themselves or their designed characters in your upcoming games. This could be as non-playable characters (NPCs), side quest givers, or even playable characters, depending on the scope of your project.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Digital Artwork:</strong>
          <p>Commission custom digital artwork of the patron's designed character. This could include concept art, character portraits, or full-body illustrations, created by you or a professional artist.</p>

      <li>
          <strong>Exclusive Skins or Costumes:</strong>

      <li>
          <strong>Character Naming Rights:</strong>
          <p>Allow patrons to name in-game characters or locations after themselves or their designed characters. This adds a personal touch to your game world and makes patrons feel directly involved in the creative process.</p>
